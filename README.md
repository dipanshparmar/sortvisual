Hello, people of the internet :wave:<br/>
Thanks for stopping by and having a look at SortVisual. But wait! Do you know actually what is SortVisual? Let's collect some info :smile:

## What is SortVisual?
SortVisual is a web based app which is responsible for visualizing various sorting algorithms in just one click. easy-peasy :wink:.

### Why it exists?
SortVisual can be helpful for those people who just started learning about algorithms. This app can help them to visualize the algorithms and see how they work behind the scenes. This will also help them to understand about time complexities that which algorithm is fast and how it is fast as compared to other algorithms.

### How to start?
You only need some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript and you're good to go. Dont' know Javascript? You can still help in UI improvements. :grin:
